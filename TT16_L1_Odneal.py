# Name: Susie Odneal
# COSC1336, Lab 1, Fix print syntax errors
#
# The easiest program just prints out a few words.
# But when learning a brand new language, even something
# "easy" can be difficult. Find and fix any errors below.
# There should be a space between words in your output.
# Each statement should print one line of text.
# Repair each print instruction so it outputs correctly.
# If it is NOT broken, don't fix it.
